# Insecure design

Lacks security controls.
Leaves apps vulnerable.
Nothing in place to reduce attacks.
Focusses risks on design flaws.
Perfect implementations still vulnerable.

* Improper error-handling

Remove components Not needed.
Keep default permissions private.

* Preventions

No used components.
Add risk when outdated.
Track installed components.
Track nested dependencies.
