# Coding without security

Apps commonly developed without security.
Insecurely developed apps highly susceptible
Downtime, fixes, and reaches are costly
involve security team early on
Development environment must be secure.

# Understanding Secure development

Without practical knowledge and understand of security, code not likely to withstand attacks.
Everyone should understand secure app development and securing the development environment
Security is a team effort. Anything touching the app, its services, its platform has a responsibility for security.
Combined talents of devops ans security brings deeper understanding of defensive code development and risks.

# What is a secure development environment?

Securing network, compute resources,storage devices on premise and on the cloud.
Attacker can:
  - steal sensitive, info: encryption keys, access keys, IP
  - Embed malicious code
  - Proxy tool for more attacks

System
  - Apply updates
  - Disable services
  - Physically secure systems
  - Separate machines for coding and business

Protect
  - Strong passwords
  - multi factor auth
  - Code repository
  - Build and deploy pipeline

Plan
  - Monitoring, logging and auditing controls
  - Continually test for security
  - Plan for flaws

# Best practices

Secure internet connection: Regular port scans, Strict firewall ingress and egress traffics
Multi-factor authentication
Additional security 
Monitoring developer environment and activities
Track commits
Prevent work around
